Eternal Father, creator of all that is good,
We come before thee with humble hearts and grateful spirits,
To offer our thanks for the blessings bestowed upon us.
Thy gracious providence sustains us through trials,
And thy bountiful hand provides for our every need.
We give thanks for the beauty of the earth,
The warmth of the sun and the coolness of the rain,
For the abundance of the harvest and the joy of family and friends.
May we never take these gifts for granted,
But always remember to give thanks for thy endless grace.
In thy holy name we pray, amen.
